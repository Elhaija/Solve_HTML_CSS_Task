      <h1> <u> introduction to chemistry </u> </h1>
      <p> <mark> Chemistry </mark> is a <u> subdiscipline of science that deals with the study of matter and the substances that constitute it </u>. 
        It also deals with the properties of these substances and the reactions <mark> undergone by them to form new substances. </mark> </p>

        <p> <del> What is chemistry? Simply put, chemistry is the study of the interactions of matter with other matter and with energy. 
            This seems straightforward enough. </del>  <mark> However, the definition of chemistry </mark> includes a wide range of topics that must be understood to gain a mastery of the topic or even take additional courses in chemistry. Get ready for a fantastic journey through a world of wonder, delight, and knowledge. One of the themes of this book is “chemistry is everywhere,” and indeed it is; you would not be alive if it weren’t for chemistry because your body is a big chemical machine. If you don’t believe it,
             don’t worry. Every chapter in this book contains </p>
