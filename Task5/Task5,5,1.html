      <h2> Description </h2>
      <p>
        A boat is a watercraft of a large range of types and sizes, but generally smaller than a ship, which is distinguished by its larger size or capacity,
         its shape, or its ability to carry boats.

        Small boats are typically used on inland waterways such as rivers and lakes, or in protected coastal areas.
        However, some boats (such as whaleboats) were intended for offshore use.
        In modern naval terms, a boat is a vessel small enough to be carried aboard a ship.
